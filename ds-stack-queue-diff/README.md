* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

the different between stack and method is in the way of value is insert  retrive and remove value
the stack is the first element is add to the stack it the last elment retrive from stack 
the queue is the first element is add to the stack it the first elment retrive from queue becuse that the queue need to another variable like tail and head to asign for the start and end the queue

examples:
when i add the (5 and 3 and 6) to the stack the stack is [5,3,6] and when i call the remove from stack the stack will be [5,3] 
but in the queue when add the (5 and 3 and 6) to the queue the queue is [5,3,6] and when i call the remove from queue the queue will be [3,6]
